# Guidelines

NOTE: If you want to import functions or files like we do in any project , in Golang specifically, we need to make its package to import it because it doesn't have anything like relative imports.

An example is written in the `examples` directory and the package `example` is imported in the `cmd/app/main.go` file.

NOTE: The functions need not have correct parameters and return data types yet

## Suggestions

`Option<u8>` can be implemented by taking a pointer to a `uint8` value ?
