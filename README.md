# Introduction

Selene is a fast, open source, portable & secure light client for Ethereum written in Golang. We plan to ship Selene as the underlying software behind wallets that use light clients. We derived our inspiration from [Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios) which is a light client written in Rust. The project is in active maintenance on the (dev)[https://github.com/BlocSoc-iitr/selene/tree/dev] branch.
